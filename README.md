# SummaAI
SummaAI is an advanced NLP-based tool developed to generate and compare text summaries using both extractive and abstractive methods. Built with TensorFlow, Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers, and NLTK, this project integrates a user-friendly Gradio interface to provide an interactive experience. Users can input any text and receive concise summaries, while also viewing ROUGE score evaluations for both summarization techniques. SummaAI offers insights into the precision, recall, and F1-score for each summary type, making it a valuable tool for researchers, content creators, and anyone interested in text analysis.
